<BR><BR><FONT size='5' color='black' face='arial'>My name is Lauren, and I did home page in this project, I put the link of each page, so everyone can know what the page is about, and when you press the link you can go in and see the page. Like parents page is doing book review, shop page is doing profiles and community page is doing statistics.
