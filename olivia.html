<BR><BR><FONT size='5' color='black' face='arial'>My name is Olivia and I am a student in KAS. In this website, I made the community page. The community provides some information to readers and it includes some reviews and surveys from middle schoolers. The 4 of us picked our favorite books and wrote a short review. The survey graph shows if middle schoolers use book recommendation websites.
